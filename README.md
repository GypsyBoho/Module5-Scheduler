## Description

- I wanted to create a better easier and visually simple way to organize my day to day 
- This simple calendar app allows you to add all of your common daily tasks by hour and save them. This prevents you from having to write the same tasks over and over again.
- Its very flexible, if you want to change one of the tasks or schedules just delete the text and replace it with the new text and it will save it
- It also visually updates based on the current time of the day, so you can see exactly what time it is at a glance
- The current time slot is represented by green, the past time slots are represented by red and the future time slots are represented in grey
- I learned a lot about Dayjs creating this app and how through Javascript and jquery we can dynamically update classes and id's based on local time.
